## Overview
We are considering opening up a surf shop in Oahu, but more details regarding the temperature in both winter and summer are needed to determine if it can be a successful year-round business. Specifically, we have been asked to look at the temperatures in June and December.


## Results
Overall, the weather between June and December is surprisingly similar, however there are a few key differences.

This query was used to return the June temperatures:
